# VBA-challenge
In this assignment we were are given stock information in an excel workbook for a three year period. The workbook was divided into three worksheets by year. We were to create a VBA file to return the ticker symbol, yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and the total stock volume of the stock. Those results were then to be used to get greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume.

In creating the VBA file this line to find total number of rows, "row_count = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row", was supplied by tutor David Choi.
